# Audio Super-Resolution
A project concerning the super-resolution of audio signals i.e. increasing the sample rate of an audio signal by using a generative adversarial network.


## Dataset
The dataset should be generated with the Python module [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) which works with the Spotify API.


## Converting a spectrogram to audio
The Python module [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) can transform an audio signal into a spectrogram and vice-versa
by using the [Griffin-Lim algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61132574/can-i-convert-spectrograms-generated-with-librosa-back-to-audio).
